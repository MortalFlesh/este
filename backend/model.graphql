# Like database/model User, but without password, webs, and DB directives.
# User webs is a special query with server defined sorting etc.
# Remember, expose only API you really need aka as minimal as possible.
# Remember, database/datamodel.graphql defines low level DB while schema.graphql
# defines high level API for clients based on the actual usage.
